## **Introduction**

This project is a modern, full-stack web application built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. It follows industry best practices for authentication, security, and RESTful API design, ensuring a **scalable, efficient, and secure** solution for web applications. The application also integrates advanced data modeling, server-side rendering, and interactive mapping for enhanced functionality.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Node.js** – High-performance server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** – Fast and minimal Node.js framework
- **MongoDB** – Flexible and scalable NoSQL database
- **Mongoose** – Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- **Pug** – Powerful template engine for server-side rendering

## **Features**

- **RESTful API** – Supports filtering, sorting, pagination, and aliasing for optimal data retrieval
- **CRUD Operations** – Robust data management using MongoDB and Mongoose
- **Advanced Data Modeling** – Efficient data relationships, embedding, referencing, and geospatial queries
- **Authentication & Authorization** – Secure user sign-up, login, password reset, and role-based access control
- **JWT Authentication** – Stateless and secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Security Best Practices** – Implements encryption, data sanitization, and rate limiting to protect against threats
- **File Uploading & Image Processing** – Uploaded images are automatically compressed and optimized
- **Email Notifications** – Transactional emails sent via Brevo
- **Interactive Maps** – Leaflet integration for dynamic location-based data visualization
- **Error Handling** – Centralized error management for better debugging and user experience

## **Authentication & Security**

- **JWT Authentication** – Secure and scalable session handling
- **Secure Password Storage** – Implements industry-standard encryption techniques
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Restricts endpoint access based on user roles (admin, user, etc.)
- **Enhanced Security Measures** – Includes rate limiting, request validation, data sanitization, and encryption mechanisms to prevent security vulnerabilities
